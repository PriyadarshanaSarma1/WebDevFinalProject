A tiny black door leads you into a room decked with chandeliers, lamps, mirrors and even a stuffed deer, creating an elegant and opulent interior. Oath hosts some of the world’s best underground DJs and serves high-quality drinks; the doors stay open until 8am on Saturdays and Sundays, meaning it’s the ideal place to go for a nijikai (after-party).</p>
