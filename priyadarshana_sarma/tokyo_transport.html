                    <p>The <span><a href = "https://www.tokyometro.jp/en/subwaymap/">Tokyo Subway</a></span> is the best way to travel in the city. The subway system connects all parts of the city, and boasts a very high on time reliability and service frequency. Buying a Suica card for the subway is highly recommended. Also, it might be a good idea to figure out the routes since most signs are in Japanese, but feel free to ask around if you feel lost.</p>

                    <p><span><a href = "https://www.jrailpass.com/shinkansen-bullet-trains">Shinkansen bullet trains</a></span> are the fastest and most convenient way of discovering Japan. The Japan Rail (JR) network is extensive and the trains reach a top speed of 320 km/h (199mp/h). Over the Shinkansen's 50-plus-year history, carrying over 10 billion passengers, there has been not a single passenger fatality or injury due to train accidents. Ride the bullet train to experience one of the fastest trips in the world other than air travel. Go out for a trip to the countryside using one of the famous bullet trains and enjoy the smooth speed. </p>

                    <p>After a long, tiring day, if one has no energy left to take the subway, take a <span><a href = "https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/guide/NTJhowto0061-en/">Taxi</a></span> ride to the next destination. Most taxis cost Y730 for the first 2km. Thereafter, the fare rises Y90 for each 280 meters traveled. The fare also rises when the taxi is stuck in traffic. All taxis accept cash, and some taxis also accept credit cards. It's very easy to catch a taxi in Tokyo. The taxi fares can be very high, but they will take you to your intended destination. </p>
