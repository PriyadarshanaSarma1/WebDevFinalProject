                    <p>The London subway or London Underground, commonly called the <span><a href = "https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/">Tube</a></span>, is the fastest way to visit any place in London. It is a rapid transit system serving Greater London and some parts of the adjacent counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. The Tube is divided into nine travel zones. Zone 1 is in central London and zones 6 to 9 are on the outskirts of the city. The Tube has its origins in the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground passenger railway. They are a cheap and convenient option. Make sure to have good walking shoes as there will be some walking from the station to the actual destination. </p>

                    <a href = "https://www.londoncitybreak.com/bus"><img src = "images/London/london_bus.jpg" alt = "image of london bus"></a>
                    <p>The iconic <span><a href = "https://www.londoncitybreak.com/bus">Double Decker Buses</a></span> are cheap and very convenient for point to point travel. The red double-decker buses in London have become a national symbol of England. The buses cover almost all the parts of the city with plenty of sightseeing opportunities along the way. London buses are all cashless, so you need an Oyster card, Travelcard or contactless payment. Bus fare is £1.50 and a day of bus-only travel will cost a maximum of £4.50. Its not as fast as the subway, so take it when not in a rush to have a scenic ride to your next destination. </p>

Only black cabs can be hailed in the street or at designated ranks situated in prominent places, including many mainline rail, Tube and bus stations. They can also be booked by telephone. If the yellow TAXI sign is on, the cab is available for hire. Black cabs are metered and there is a minimum charge of £3.20. Additional charges apply when you take a black cab from Heathrow, book by telephone, and on Christmas Day and New Year's Eve. All black cabs accept payment by credit or debit card, and there is no surcharge on the taxi fare for card payment. After a long tiring day, go to your next destination in luxury in one of these cabs. </p>
